<div class="container">Warner Bros. Pictures brought Barbie to life in the company's highest-earning theatrical release of all time. Directed by Greta Gerwig, the project was in the works for quite some time. Back in December 2016, Amy Schumer was originally attached to star, however, she later backed out of the film due to creative differences. In January 2019, it was confirmed that Margot Robbie would be taking on the lead role of the iconic Mattel doll, and in October 2021, Ryan Gosling joined the cast as Barbie's plastic partner, Ken. Robbie spoke about the movie's toy-tastic style during a December 2022 conversation with Carey Mulligan for Variety's "Actors on Actors" series. When Mulligan asked if the film would have any Barbie houses, Robbie responded, "The Dreamhouses? You'll see some Dreamhouses. And it will be everything you ever dreamed of." On April 25, 2023, a preview of the film was shown at CinemaCon 2023 in Las Vegas. During the event, Gerwig spoke about her joyful experience filming the movie and said she "cried when I stepped on the set for the first time." Robbie, who also helped present the preview at CinemaCon, told Gerwig, "You were just so happy; we felt that every day." While there are currently no plans for a Barbie sequel, Robbie has hinted that another movie is possible. In June 2023, the actress said that the story "could go a million different directions from this point." The following month, Gerwig also talked about the possibility of a sequel — or sequels — when she told PEOPLE she hopes her film "is the launch of a world and a bunch of different Barbie movies," adding, "I want to go back to Barbie Land." Whether Barbie gets a sequel or not, this film is a certified hit, making $1 billion at the box office in a little over two weeks. And the film is set to pull in even more viewers this fall. In August 2023, Warner Bros. Pictures announced that the film would be released in IMAX theaters for a one-week limited engagement, beginning Sept. 22. This version of the film will include brand-new footage chosen by Gerwig. "We made Barbie for the big screen, so it’s an even bigger thrill to be able to bring it to IMAX, the biggest screen of all," the director said in a statement. "And as a special thanks to Barbie fans, we’re excited to share a little bit more of our cast and crew’s incredible work by adding special new footage we hope audiences will enjoy.” From the cast to the soundtrack, here's everything to know about the Barbie movie.</div>
